# Customer Segmentation for Strategic Insights

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying distinct customer segments from a dataset using unsupervised machine learning. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can inform targeted business and marketing strategies.

- **Objective & Data Preparation:** To segment customers, the project began with essential data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and using RobustScaler to manage outliers.
- **Optimal Cluster Identification:** The ideal number of customer segments was identified as two by using a combination of the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** analysis.
- **Segmentation with K-Means:** A **K-Means clustering** model was then applied to the prepared data, effectively grouping customers into two distinct segments based on their shared characteristics.
- **Visualization & Insights:** Finally, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** was used to visualize the clusters, providing clear and actionable insights into each customer group for targeted business strategies.
